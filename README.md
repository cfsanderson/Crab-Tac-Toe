# Crab-Tac-Toe

My family and I eat at the Anna Maria Oyster Bar for lunch nearly every Sunday. One of our favorite things to do is play tic-tac-toe while we wait for our food. I styled this version to match the beachy theme of the restaurant. Now we play this intead of wasting napkins.

Although this turned into a fun family project, it started out as part of my coursework at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/).
